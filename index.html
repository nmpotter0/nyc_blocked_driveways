    		<h1>NYC Driveway Blocking Violations</h1>
    		<p>
    			Inspired by <a href="http://iquantny.tumblr.com/post/144197004989/the-nypd-was-systematically-ticketing-legally">I Quant NY's analysis of erroneous parking violations for blocked pedestrian ramps,</a> I decided to visualize NYC parking violations for blocked driveways. The map above depicts the density of these violations for the majority of Fiscal Year 2016 (7/1/2015 - 6/16/2016).<br><br>I was interested to see how the distribution of violations relates to the distribution of blocked driveway reports. This relationship is depicted below as the ratio by zip code of 311 requests concerning blocked driveways to violations. As expected, the outer boroughs have higher rates of reports to violations, while numerous zip codes in Midtown had more violations occur than 311 requests.
